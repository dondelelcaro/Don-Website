[[!meta title="Reading Data into R"]]

Most of the time that I use R, I'm operating on data which has been
generated or entered somewhere else. For me, that means SNP genotyping
results, microarray scans, and spreadsheets. For you, that may mean
stock market prices, Census data, or any one of a myriad of other data
formats.
