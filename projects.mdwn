Projects
========

 These are some of the more recent publicly available projects that
 I've been working on. Most of the code here is available under the
 GPL, but check the licences in individual files or e-mail me if it is
 unclear. Everything here is primarily used by me, and may not be
 suitable for you. Feel free to e-mail me with any questions or
 patches, though. As always, Caveat Lector.



Reference System
----------------

Originally written in PHP, the reference system is being totally
rewritten in perl with mod_perl, postgresql and various other
routines. It was originally designed to track scholarly articles and
hold note and references related to them. However, the new version of
the system will be used to track everything from books to images to
newspapers to songs. Basically, it's a portable memory system that
happens to be web based and accessible from any where in the planet.

 * [PHP CVS](http://rzlab.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ref_php/?root=Ref+CVS)
 * [New CVS](http://rzlab.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ref/?root=Ref+CVS)

Utilities Modules
-----------------
The new reference system has lead me to redesign many of the modules
that I use alot. Most of them now can be plugged into and out of perl
programs at will, decreasing development time of mod_perl based web
projects. More importantly, it makes my code a lot more modular, and
keeps me from going insane tracking it all.

 * Class::Modular is a superclass that allows one to generate a single
   class from modules spread throughout multiple files and overload
   methods within that class at will. Da::DB inherits from
   Class::Modular. [svn repository](http://rzlab.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/?root=Class+Modular)
 * Da::DB is the main Database class. All (or almost all) database
   interaction occurs through da_dbh objects or dynamically loaded sub
   modules of Da::DB. (The new Template::Provider code is an example
   of a loadable sub module.) [svn repository](http://rzlab.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/?root=Da+DB)

Micro Array Utilities
---------------------
These R functions and a few perl scripts are used to analyse Gene
Microarray data from affymetrix datafiles.
