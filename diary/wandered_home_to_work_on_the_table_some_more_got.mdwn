Wandered home to work on the table some more, got the legs completed, but not exactly as I envisioned them. (A 60 degree cut with a 4 degree angle is extreemly difficult to produce on just about any thing short of a band saw... and I wasn't using a band saw.\n\nThen I came back home to take care of some more grading. Ugh. I loathe grading exams. Some of the answers are so inane.\n\nOh yes. I'm also getting quite sick. Starting blowing the green snot today. Hopefully my immune system will kick in and attack my cold, but if not, off to the antibiotics it is.
