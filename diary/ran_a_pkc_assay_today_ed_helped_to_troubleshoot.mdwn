Ran a PKC assay today, Ed helped to troubleshoot the assay for os, and it looks like it was a pH issue. I'll check the results tomorrow, and we'll see how it went. Hopefully it was something like that that was causing the problem, so we can start making repeatable assays once more.\n\nI also went out to [http://www.deep-la.com/| Deep] which is held at vynyl, in hollywood. (It was the first week back after the [http://www.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/31/wmc/index.html|miami WMC]...) Marques Wyatt played some nice grooves, that pretty much had people moving all night long.\n\nThen the long drive back, and now I'm going to read some more LotR before I go to sleep.
