Got my transcript request in today, hopefully I'll get a graduate fellowship so I don't have to pay to go to gradschool. (Or at least, don't have to pay too much. Started an experiment in my lab, samples will continute evaporating overnight. Got Dj Diz's set from 10-21-2000 cut and burned for Tim. [http://www.reelhouse.net|reelhouse.net] (It's fun cutting up a 1.2G soundfile. {Especially on a dual xeon with raid 1+0 ;-)}) Found out that I still suck at Half Life. (Just not enough hours in the day to get good at it. bleh.) Finally got around to getting my Biochem 110B book, hopefully I'll spend some time studying before the next quiz.
