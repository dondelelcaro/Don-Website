Woke up, went to hear a good talk on engineering salt water tolerant plants by increasing the copynumber of the vacuolar Na+/H+ antiport. Looks like it might allow plants to be able to be grown quite effectively in high-salt environments. I ate lunch with the presenter, Dr. Eduardo Blumwald, pretty neat guy, masters in israel, phd in berkely, professor in toronto, and now at UC Davis.\n\nThen it was back to my house for another round of writing and reading. I just about finished everything up before being unable to continue. (Sometime around 4A).
