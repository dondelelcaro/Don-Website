Was on campus making NMR samples for most of the day, then spent the evening working on assignment 1 for GNT 240. It's going along pretty well, but there are some definite holes that need to be filled, which I will get around to later.\n\nAlso talked briefly with angela and milan as I was wandering back from getting something to drink from coffee shop on campus. (I'm a coffee fiend... well, perhaps I should say, a caffeine fiend.)\n\nLearning latex in the context of doing this assingment, which is going along pretty well. Although I can definetly see that I am going to need to purchase one of the books on the subject so I can progress a bit faster than I have been able to do recently.\n\nMore work, then sleep.
