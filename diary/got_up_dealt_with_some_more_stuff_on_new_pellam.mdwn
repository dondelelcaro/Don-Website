Got up, dealt with some more stuff on new pellam, getting cvs and rsync up and running to mirror content to a web server. Played badly at intermural basketball, and then came back to deal with the frogsleap website, some more setup on pellam, watched X-boc (?), and repaired a keyboard that fell victim to a frozen coke. (not mine ;-) Spent some time trying to get the domain name policy list to work better and present facts. Looks like an uphil battle. [Flame throwers anyone?]
