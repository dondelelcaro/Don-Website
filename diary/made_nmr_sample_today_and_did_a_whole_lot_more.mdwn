Made nmr sample today, and did a whole lot more work on getting reliable statistical analysis for gene arrays.\n\nTomorrow I am going to have to begin to write out the protocol for analyzing genetic arrays, and testing for genetic diversity among the control and disease populations.\n\nI also did a whole lot more checking into endpoint analysis (where you have more than one comparison test) ala Bonferonni corrections. More work needs to be done on it, but I think i'll get there eventually.\n\nBeyond that, I also went to GNT 240A, and we had a small discussion on the papers that were assigned to be read in class, and wandered over to the sproul computer lab to work on the computers there. I need to take care of my assignment for that class soon, before I run out of time to do it.\n\nNow it's time for glorious sleep.
