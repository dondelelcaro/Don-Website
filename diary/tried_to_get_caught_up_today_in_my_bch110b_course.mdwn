Tried to get caught up today in my bch110B course. I managed to do the reading for 2 chapters in about two hours, not to bad. I also got the PMS system to finally boot properly off of new pellam. For some reason, the nfs server doesn't like my swtich to much. Probably has something to do with the MTU size or something. I also had some really good baclava today that my professor got. Mmmm... Love baclava.
