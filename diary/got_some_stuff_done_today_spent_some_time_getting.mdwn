Got some stuff done today. Spent some time getting caught up for the biochem quiz. Took care of some random computer stuff that was requiring my attention, spent part of the day on the phone about the frog's leap website. Started to change some code on pcron, and also wrote up the CRC expectations for my replacement. Ooo. How exciting. ;-)
