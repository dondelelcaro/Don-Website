My bio 200B was pretty intersting today, learned a bit about rRNA splicing and tRNA splicing. Spent some time chillin' in comons, then took yet another midterm. I really need to stop taking midterms, as they eat soo much of my time. ;-) After that I tried to relax and played some more CS. I'm getting better, but I still suxor.
