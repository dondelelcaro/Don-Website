More writing. Much more writing. Loads and loads of writing and thinking. That's pretty much all that I did today. As I'm still new to this whole grant writing thing, and not an expert by any means on the area that I'm writing the grant on, it's taking quite a large amount of time to compile the evidence to support my hypothesis and develop the methodology to run the experiment in a competent manner. I know I'll get there, but it's taking quite a lot of time and effort.
