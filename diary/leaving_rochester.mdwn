[gal://2003/06_june/brainfroot_06282003/26_waldo_mary_ellen_travis_and_erin.jpg]Well, my time in Rochester, NY is coming to and end. I'm sitting right now in my apartment that is almost completely devoid of stuff; my car is packed to the brim; even my bikes are on top. I went to brainfroot #9 over the weekend, and saw so many people that I had spent fun times with over the year; I'm going to miss every one of them.\n\n[gal://2003/06_june/brainfroot_06282003/21_the_masses.jpg]Waldo just showed up and picked up my microwave and computer chair (thanks!) and so now I'm typing lying on the floor. Lemme link up two pictures, and then it's time to figure out where in rochester Time Warner Cable's office is so I can return this cable modem.\n\nWell, it's time to hit the road. I'll put up my adventures in about 10 days once I'm plugged back into the information stream again.
