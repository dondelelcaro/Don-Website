Drove home from SF on the 5 early in the morning. Got in at around 1P to riverside.\n\nAngela D came out to riverside from LA (after being in FL and DC) and I got to see pictures of her trip to DC, and some of the friends she made while out there.\n\nRandy also came with his girlfriend and we (along with paul, brian, and wendy) went to korean bbq for dinner (which was good, although I can't handle eating there all that often...)\n\nThen I wandered back home, watched some TV, and continued reading Silmarillion.
