Interesting mayday. Lots of events going on in the wide, wide world, but not too much recognition of Labor Day in the US. I personally spent most of the day running an experiment and taking some stuff for the BBRC paper that we are going to be submitting in the near future.\n\nAfter that, I got my tables set up and spun for the first time in quite some time. I need to start buying records en mass again. More work on my links setup, and sleep is definetly beckoning.
