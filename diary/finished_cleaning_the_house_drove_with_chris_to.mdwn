Finished cleaning the house, drove with chris to SF, and dropped chris off at the lions club, and picked up a neat bag at [http://www.yakpak.com|Yak Pak] on haight near masonic.\n\nThen more chilling at the lion's club, an awesome bit of food somewhere on divisidero, and hanging out with justin, doc, rachael, jen, and some other people at justin, doc and rachael's apartment. Got to play GTA3 and hear justin's new track. (GTA3 is such a great game... totally without any redeming social qualities.)\n\nDropped chris off at his place and I'm going to crash at seth's apartment for a bit before I drive back to Rside.
