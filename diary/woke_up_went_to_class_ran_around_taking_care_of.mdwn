Woke up, went to class. Ran around taking care of stuff for the lab (starting samples, survey meter calibration). Picked up a paper that I was missing for my grant, and then went home, wrote some more, took a nap, read more, wrote more, ate, read more, wrote more.\n\nIt's quite odd to be spending a large portion of your time reading and writing. Up until recently, I spent most of my time actually doing active things. It will take some getting used to.
