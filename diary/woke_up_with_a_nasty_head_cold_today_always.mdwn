Woke up with a nasty head cold today. Always annoying when that happens. Got the door finished for the room, wandered to home depot in the rain, got the white latex for the door, mark managed to spill some of it on his pant leg in the car with my help ;-(.\n\nAfter two coats of paint on the door, it looks like a door should. (I've realized that I really hate dealing with doors.) Then more cleanup in the room, and waiting for the paint to dry enough for the door hardware to go on. Probably will have to wait until tomorrow for that.
