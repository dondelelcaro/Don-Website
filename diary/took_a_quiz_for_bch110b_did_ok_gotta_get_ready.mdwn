Took a quiz for bch110B, did ok, gotta get ready for the midterm. Went to discussion in Bio 200B, and heard some papers presented. Went to lecture for 110B, and then hung around campus for a bit, before getting back to work in my room, getting pms ready to go. Got a NMR sample stated, installed the new GX110's in the AI Lab, and installed PMS into lothain. Also started giving out passwords on new pellam. Hopefully new pellam will survive. ;-)
