Spent time developing some new products, did some more cleanup on frog's leap, probably kill it tomorrow. Working on getting the card reading for PMS working, gotta look at that code with a clear head and run a bit of a cleanup on it. (It's not ugly, but it could use a bit of cleanup here and there. ;-) Talked to my mom who is making me a "case" for the new G4, a pouch like thing primarily to protect the machine from abrasion and the like. Should be cool. Went grocery shopping too for the first time in a while. [Was starving here. ;-)]. Updated the anti-spam orbs rules on my boxes, flipped back on a box that got cycled, and tried to clean up some other stuff. Ooo exciting!
