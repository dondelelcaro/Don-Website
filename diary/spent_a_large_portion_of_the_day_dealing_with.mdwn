Spent a large portion of the day dealing with drama over the pellam switchover, getting the labs printing again, making NMR samples, and commenting up the psdaemon for pms. Today was one of those days that just dissapeared some where in the cracks while I was working on a lot of stuff. Oh yeah... I also judged Mr. AI and spent some time at in-n-out. Got to study for bio110B quiz on friday. Yuck.
