Worked more on the linking part of the reference system, cleaned up some more of the backyard that needed to be taken care of. Partook in the 2.99 combo special at carl's jr, and continued working on the reference system.\n\nI have to finish the rest of the in-note linking system soon.\n\nI also picked up a copy of the directors cut of Blade Runner, which is pretty good... however there still is some flutter in the digitization, that probably shouldn't have been there. Quite obvious that they used a projector to digitize it. (I wonder why they don't use a whole film scanner... but... )
