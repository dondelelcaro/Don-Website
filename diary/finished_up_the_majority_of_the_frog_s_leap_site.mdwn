Finished up the majority of the Frog's Leap site, still some cleanup that needs to be taken care of... probably another 4 hours worth of work. Played basketball for about 3 hours, felt good, but made me realize just how out of shape I am. Did some intruder tracking on some boxes around here that were having issues... but other than that, things look ok...
