Spent the majority of today working on the frog's leap site in preparation for the release on tuesday. I should be far enough along on the process to have a release on time. I also watched some anime on the sci-fi channel and spent some more time playing with the new G4. Trying to get the wacom tablet that I have out here so I can sketch on the power book too.
