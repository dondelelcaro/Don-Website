Took my bch110B midterm, did ok.. probably should have done better. Scored one of the new powerbook G4's. (Thing is tight!). Spent time in class, ran pkc assay until 11P or so. Then got back, went to Starbucks for a bit, and spent the rest of the night (well, morning really) working on the frogsleap site.
