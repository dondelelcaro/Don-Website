[[!meta title="A Dozen and a Gross meet Numerology"]]

Laurel sent me this gem[^1], which lead me to find the wikipedia page on
[Mathematical Jokes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_joke):

[[!teximg code="\frac{12+114+20+3\sqrt{3}}{7}+5\cdot11=9^2+0"]]

A Dozen, a Gross, and a Score,  
plus three times the square root of four,  
divided by seven,  
plus five times eleven,  
equals nine squared and not a bit more.  

And from there, I found another:

[[!teximg code="\int^{\sqrt[3]{3}}_1 \! z^2\, \mathrm{d}z \cdot \cos \frac{3\pi}{9}=\log \sqrt[3]{e}"]]

Integral z-squared dz  
From 1 to the cube root of 3  
Times the cosine  
Of three pi over 9  
Equals log of the cube root of e.
