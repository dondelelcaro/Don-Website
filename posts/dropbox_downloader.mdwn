[[!meta title="Dropbox Recursive Downloader"]]

I'm working on some analyses for the
[Genetic Analysis Workshop #19](http://www.gaworkshop.org/gaw19/index.html),
which has placed it's data on Dropbox. Unfortunately, Dropbox doesn't
allow for people to download zip archives larger than 1GB, and the
data was made available in an unpacked structure with more than a
hundred files. Some searching indicated that no one had written a
recursive downloader for Dropbox, so 30 minutes of hacking with
[WWW::Mechanize](http://search.cpan.org/~ether/WWW-Mechanize-1.73/lib/WWW/Mechanize.pm)
later, I wrote a
[simple recursive downloader for Dropbox](http://git.donarmstrong.com/?p=bin.git;a=blob;f=dropbox_recursive;hb=HEAD)

Two hours later, all of the files had downloaded.
