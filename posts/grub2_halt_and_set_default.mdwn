[[!meta title="Changing Grub2's default boot entry and halting"]] 

I have a mythtv box which (when working) records television shows for
me. As I'm not interested in the vast majority of shows shown on US
television, it spends most of it's time off, waiting for a show that I
want to record. This requires using `nvram-wakeup`, and one of the
oddities of my machine's bios is that it wants to be rebooted after
setting the nvram.
[This is likely do to Debian writing to the RTC after the nvram being updated, but not setting the RTC seems stupid.]
After the reboot, the machine should halt, and grub should be
configured to start the machine normally once the bios starts.

As grub2 now supports named default entries, this is fairly
straightforward. We create a menu entry like the following in
`/etc/grub.d/40_custom`:

     menuentry 'halt' {
             set saved_entry=0;
             save_env saved_entry;
             load_env;
             halt;
     }

make sure that `GRUB_DEFAULT="saved"` in `/etc/default/grub`; and set MythShutdownNvramRestartCmd to `/usr/sbin/grub-set-default halt`:

     mysql mythdb -e "UPDATE settings SET data='/usr/sbin/grub-set-default halt' WHERE value='MythShutdownNvramRestartCmd'";

and viola, the machine now behaves properly with grub2.
