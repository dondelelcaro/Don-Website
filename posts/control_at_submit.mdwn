[[!meta title="Debbugs: Control at Submit time"]]

One of the features that I have been asked for multiple times is the
ability to use control@bugs.debian.org commands at
submit@bugs.debian.org time. I have now implemented this with the
following syntax:

    Package: foo
	Version: 1.0-3
	Control: retitle -1 this is the title
	Control: severity -1 bleargh
	Control: summary -1 0
	Control: forward -1 http://bugs.debian.org/nnn

In short, you preface any control commands with Control:, -1 is the
current bug, and the rest of each line is the control@ grammar you
already know. This also now works for every kind of message to
nnn@bugs.debian.org with the exception of messages received at
nnn-done and nnn-forwarded. I don't know why you'd use it for anything
else but submit@ messages, but hey, whatever works.
