[[!meta title="Introducing Sweavealike"]]

I use [R](http://www.r-project.org) a lot. It's one of the primary
tools I use in my day job as a scientist analyzing large datasets. If
you use [LaTeX](http://ctan.org) with R (as I often do), you probably
use Sweave to interleave R output and figures with your text
describing those figures using the noweb method of literate
programming.

[Sweavealike](http://git.donarmstrong.com/?p=ikiwiki_plugins.git;a=blob;f=sweavealike.pm;hb=HEAD)
 is a plugin for [IkiWiki](http://ikiwiki.info) that tries
to do some of the useful things for IkiWiki that sweave does for R and
LaTeX. 

You use it like the following:

    \[[!sweavealike echo=1 code="""
    a <- 1
    a <- a + 10
    print(a)
    """]]

which produces this result when run:

[[!sweavealike echo=1 code="""
a <- 1
a <- a + 10
print(a)
"""]]

You can also generate figures with it:

    \[[!sweavealike fig=1 echo=1 results="hide" code="""
    plot(1:10,(1:10)^2,xlab="x",ylab=expression(x^2),main="Example Figure")
    """]]

[[!sweavealike fig=1 echo=1 results="hide" code="""
plot(1:10,(1:10)^2,xlab="x",ylab=expression(x^2),main="Example Figure")
"""]]

The plugin itself uses the neat Statistics::R perl module to handle
all of the heavy lifting. I personally plan on using this plugin to
help write some more entries in my learning R series of posts that I'm
beginning to work on. Hopefully I'll find and fix most of the bugs as
I embark on that process so anyone else who uses the plugin won't, but
feel free to e-mail me if something isn't working as it should.

Finally, you shouldn't run this plugin on a publicly editable
IkiWiki instance, because that would be a trivial local user exploit
as R can run arbitrary code, read and write to arbitrary files,
exhaust all memory, etc.
