[[!meta title="YA Reason why I â™¥ UNIX"]] 


Trying to do some work for the
[Mystery Hunt](http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle) which starts on Friday at
noon, and the wireless at MIT keeps deauthenticating me for reason 1.
(Which apparently is the dreaded "unknown reason for
deauthentication".) Reassociating makes everything work again. Fast,
hack solution:

     while sleep 1s; do
	  if iwconfig wireless |grep -q "ESSID:off"; then
	    iwconfig wireless essid "MIT GUEST";
        echo "reset wireless";
	  fi;
	 done;

and I'm back at work with relatively continuous network connectivity.
