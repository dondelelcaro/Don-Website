[[agimg 2003/april/frosted_subaru_04042003.jpg ]]Just wandered though a rather wierd bout of freezing rain. I think
freezing rain is my current least favorite form of weather, due mainly
to the thick layers of ice it deposits upon every surface. Much, much
more nasty than snow, and wet to boot.

[[agimg 2003/march/making_of_3dim_xyz/19.jpg ]]Been extreemly busy doing all sorts of random things here and there. I
cut the first part of a CD with Chyna and Marcus, which we are
currently planning on calling 3 Dimensions: x,y & z. I still haven't
heard the final mastered cut, (as it's still in production) but I'm
assured that it's pretty decent. [Yes, I know I need to get unlazy and
cut a demo of my own. I'll get around to it eventually.]

Stuff is, as expected, going to pot in Iraq. Not too terribly happy
with the direction that the war has taken, but of course, I was
unhappy with the absolute total lack of planning and direction comming
from the current administration before we undertook this rather
slipshod operation. Since the start, my dissapointment has been
growing geometrically. When will the US learn that it's HumInt
capability is the laughing stock of developed nations? Granted, our
ElInt is (in general) top notch, but not everyone is stupid enough to
send vital messages in the clear, or use cell phones. (Yes, my GnuPG
