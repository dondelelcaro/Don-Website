[[agimg 2003/06_june/backyard_funk_06202003/dancers_2_06202003.jpg ]]Last night, Dave, Chyna and a bunch of other house heads put together an awesome party, both to listen to awesome house tracks spun by some impressive local dj's, and to wish Marcus McGowan and myself a safe and happy trip wherever to Florida and California, respectively. I had a great time, and I think everyone else there had fun. Unfortunatly, it managed to rain lightly around midnight, and started to really pick up at around 1:30, so everyone got a mite bit damp, but no one stopped dancing.
