Went to classes, dealt with the actual pellam switchover, signeed more papers, played basketball and won again, then dealt with ants that seem to be escaping the wet outside going nuts over an empty burger wrapper in my trash can. Yeah. Real geniuses these ants. (Course, there is that Carl's Jr. commercial... but I digress.) Um yeah. I guess that's it.
