Today was rediculously eventfull. Found out that I have to take 3 units next quarter to graduate, so that's good. Also analyzed results from an experiment that we rean last week, looking good there. Fixed the menubar script for the frog's leap site I hope. (Die Netscape!) Ran the RCC meeting with the new RCC's that we picked up, attended the HR Meeting. I also got the card readers today for PMS (Printing Managment System), so I've got to update that code this week and replace the card readers on the kiosk downstairs. Ooo... joy! Anyway, off to sleep.
