I've been spending the past three weeks preparing to take my written exams. Yerp. Three solid weeks of studying, with breaks for some of the reasearch that I'm doing and programming a bit on the side. It will be nice when I get these tests behind me on wednesday, and can concentrate on everything else that I am doing.

Seems that it was left to the dogs rather literally, and weeds have built up in the back, as well as a few problems with the sprinkler lines. I'll get around to cleaning that up sometime next week, so we'll see how it all looks in a month or so once the grass has had a chance to sprout and regrow in place of the weeds and everything else that is there now.

My research is progressing slowly, and I've also been spending a fair amount of time looking for contract work so I can pay for yet another year of grad school. Anyone who is looking for contract mod_perl programmers, or expert system administrators, I'm all ears.
