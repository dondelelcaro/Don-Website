Attended CS 238, got a mathmatician's introduction to molecular biology and genetics (not like I needed it), then ate lunch, then went to GNT 240B where linkage maps and the methods of obtaining them were discussed in rather loose fashion.

I also prepared two NMR samples to hopefully put the finishing touches on the BBRC paper before coming home, and working on some of the [http://www.grandmarc.com|Grand Marc] issues. Then I wandered out to starbucks, and hit up alberto's too.

Now more LotR and sleep becons me.
