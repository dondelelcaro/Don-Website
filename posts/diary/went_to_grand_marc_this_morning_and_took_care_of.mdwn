Went to grand marc this morning, and took care of some problems resulting from the failure of a hard drive. Also dealt with a modem issue, one that I haven't had to deal with in quite a long time. (Definetly very annoying!).\n\nThen I came back to the house, continued working on the reference system. You can now upload files correctly, and add links as appropriate.\n\nNext I need to get some icons for it so the add (blah) controls are smaller and easier to deal with. (Right now they are all text.)
