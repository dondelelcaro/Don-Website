[gal://2003/06_june/dickies_06242003/0615.jpg]Well, tonight was my last time at one of my favorite hangouts in Rochester, NY. I can't remember how many times I've been to Dicky's or how many Guinesses I've drunk there. I played for a bit tonight, and hung out for a bit longer; passed my new CD out to some people who I hadn't given it to yet, and said good by to people who I probably won't see again. Ugh. Such an interesting year, filled with so many wonderfull and fun people.\n\n[gal://2003/06_june/dickies_06242003/0591.jpg] I've been trying to get everything squared away for my long drive back to california. Some things are falling into place, I've now got my tent ready; I've got racks for my bikes, but other things are lagging far behind. Oh well. The 30th is rapidly approaching. Whatever isn't dealt with by then will just naturally be taken care of by attrition.
