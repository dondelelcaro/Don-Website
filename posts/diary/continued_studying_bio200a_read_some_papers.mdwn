Continued studying bio200a, read some papers, finished up the last two remaining figures for a paper which I am a middle author (helical wheel), went to albertos for the first time in quite a long time with paul. Talked with angela and mandee on the phone, both of whom I haven't seen in quite some time.\n\nIt's flipping freezing around here, and it's time to go to sleep.
