Well, I finally rolled out the new system. There are a few bugs here and there, so if you find them, please e-mail me and I'll probably correct them. I'll also hopefully get around to sticking the source for this attrocious piece of ware up sometime too, so you can check it out.

I spent a good part of the day hacking on this site, but I took a break around 9P to go see Gangs of New York. Gangs of NY was a surprisingly decent film, although I perhaps wrongly expected much much more of Scorsese. At times the film was a bit more disjointed than it could be, with some scenes, while obviously intended to be distinct to impart the break in Amsterdam's emotions, were almost haphazardly strewn about. The soundtrack was also abysmal both in content, and in terms the mixdown, although the non-music portion of the audio track was spot on. DiCapro disapeared in his character, even though the love scenes in the movie were kind of childish.

All in all, it was a prety decent flick, and I enjoyed being forced to deploy the butcher at least initially, then beginning to see things from his point of view and pittying him, then once again disdaining his presence, and finally as he dies, identifying with his ultimate pitifullness and the tiny part he has to play in the life of New York around five points itself.

Anyway, hopefully things are working. ;-)
