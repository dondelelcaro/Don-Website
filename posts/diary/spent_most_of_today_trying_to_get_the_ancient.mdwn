Spent most of today trying to get the ancient conquest computers we have installed in the computer labs around here replaced. Turns out that we couldn't find the keys for AI, so only one lab got replaced. Whatever. [Oh yeah. Today was also my birthday. Spent most of it doing stuff for other people... how typical.... ;-)] Anyway, got to play diablo II a bit, much better at that then CS. Spent some time looking for a house to move into, and some other fun stuff. Quite Exciting.
