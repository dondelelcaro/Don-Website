Today I wandered around, depositing money into bank accounts, visiting HB and picking up my board, watching garbage tv, then comming back out to Rside.

I ended up seeing heist with my brother... it was a semi-decent movie, not terribly innovating. Some decent twists, acceptable acting, but nothing ground breaking, or especially worth seeing.

After that, I ended up working on my diary submission script some more. Hopefully I'll end up getting it working to some semi-reasonable degree.
