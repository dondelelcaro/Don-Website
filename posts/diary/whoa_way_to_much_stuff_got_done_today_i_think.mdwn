Whoa. Way to much stuff got done today. I think I'm going to have to become lazy for the next couple weeks to make up for it.\n\nRegistered for classes, took care of a hold on my registration (not in that order), made NMR samples, attended class, started running an NMR sample that I had made previously, got the felix converter working correctly for at least some of its imput set, and read a bit.\n\nStill got a big long push for my single final on tuesday, but I think I can make it until then. Hopefully.
