[[!agimg 2004/07_july/farm_trip_07_2004/landscape/007_even_more_wildflowers_20040704.jpg ]] I spent an extended Fourth of July weekend in Ottowa, IL at the family farm learning about what was going on and who the major players were. It's always quite interesting to see how the food that is eaten gets produced and the technology that goes into making it all happen.

We also ended up walking the perimeter of the farm to check the fences and make sure no one had been dumping in the land (and the stuff that had been dumped earlier was being cleaned up.)
