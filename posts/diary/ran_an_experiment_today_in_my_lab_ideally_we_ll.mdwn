Ran an experiment today in my lab, ideally we'll get some decent results. Had to spend time studying for 110B, since I have a quiz at 8A in the morning. Finally got well after being down for a couple of days... hopefully I'll stay that way. 200B was pretty interesting, and spent some time chit-chatting with people at lunch. Not quite as many different things as yesterday, but still quite a full day.
