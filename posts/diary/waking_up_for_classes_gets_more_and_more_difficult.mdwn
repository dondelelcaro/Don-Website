Waking up for classes gets more and more difficult the longer the quarter goes on. Luckily, we're already half way through the quarter, so I won't have much longer to hold out.

I ended up seeing my professor's talk (quite decent) on chemokines and Eta signal transduction in primary brain endothelial cells, after going to my bio200a class earlier in the morning. Really need to get this paper for bio200a finished sometime today, but it's very slow going. At least I kind of know in which direction I should be heading now.

We'll see what sort of evils tomorrow brings to me.
