[[!agimg 2003/07_july/to_smith_falls_NE_07022003/04_smith_falls_07022003.jpg ]]I finally made it to Smith Falls, NE on what is my longest planned
drive of the trip. I left Pikes Peak, IA at 6A CDT this morning, and
drove for almost 11 hours to get here. Quite a long drive, but at the
end of it, Smith Falls is pretty dang impressive. But first, before I
forget, I should talk slightly about Pikes Peak.

[[!agimg 2003/07_july/to_pikes_peak_IA_07012003/14_bridal_veil_falls_07012003.jpg ]]Pikes Peak is a pretty interesting place right on the IA side of the
Mississippi river where the Wisconson river comes in. It's about 8
miles south of the Mounds National Monument, and there are a few
mounds inside the state park as well. The mounds are rather
interesting. I suppose if you were to suddenly come upon one, you
probably wouldn't even know it, as they're pretty unassuming for the
most part. In fact, untill I saw more than one of them, I thought it
was just a interesting coincidence. Unfortunatly, I didn't actually
get to go to the National park's mounds, as I was pressed for time,
and it was nearing dusk when I arrived. However, I took a pretty
decent panorama of the Wisconson side from the Iowa side, so it will
be interesting to see how that turns out.

as I wandered over to a minature falls called Bridal Veil. For those
of you who have seen the big Bridal Veil falls at Yosemite, this was
its midget third cousin. (But still neat in its own little way.)
[Interesting (or depressing?) side note: Mosquitoes in Pikes Peak are
nasty. I think I got bit about 20 times, most of them look pretty
ugly. Worse, the dumb mosquitoes were so huge that their anesthetic
doesn't work very well, so I spent most of the time while cooking
trying to beat the buggers off while avoiding blowing up my stove.]
After leaving Pikes Peak, I drove, and drove, and drove, and
drove. 600 miles in single day is alot of driving, especially when
most of it is done at 55-60mph (US 20 for about 450 of those
miles). But arrive here safely I did. [There are a few pictures of the
drive... US 20 adroitly avoids most property lines, but for miles on
end it is arrow straight (although it does go up and down hills.)]

[[!agimg 2003/07_july/to_smith_falls_NE_07022003/11_don_armstrong_at_smith_falls_07022003.jpg ]]Smith Falls itself is about 14 miles East of Valentine, NB on NB
12. It's a small park with about 12 or so car acessible spots, and
about 20 primitive sites. I got slotted into one of the car spots,
which is ok... although it really didn't matter to me. The Niobrara
river burbles away right behind me (and a few canoeists have floated
buy in the time I've been typing this.)

[[!agimg /2003/07_july/to_smith_falls_NE_07022003/09_smith_falls_07022003.jpg ]]The falls itself are pretty impressive, apparently the largest falls
in all of Nebraska. No where near as tall as the falls in my favorite
place, Havasupai, but still pretty nice, and definetly more than I was
expecting.

Anyway, I'm going stick the pictures on this machine, and then close
up shop; I need both hands free to stave of flies.
