well, at 8A it was time to get to campus to stop the NMR so someone could start running their samples at 9A. Did that, then came back, tried to eat something resembling a breakfast, and went back to campus for my class as 11A.

After class, I prepared samples for the PKC assay, and then started to read [http://www.actsofgord.com], a quite interesting website. Go me.

Then home, finished asimov's prelude to foundation, and have started reading foundation's edge, the current end to the fountation series. (I already read the trilogy...)
