Last bit of studying for my final happened today. Finished making up the outline and stuff like that.\n\nI'll probably post it in a new section for work that I have done somewhere on this website, well after the final. (There are some other things that I want to take care of before that.)\n\nGot to talk with Abe, one of the members of one infinity, hopefully I'll get to talk with the whole group soon... missed them when they were down in LA unfortunatly...\n\nDogs didn't seem to like it too much when it oddly started hailing today. Can't say that I blame them. (They went into their dogloo to hide... but came out a couple of times because they seemed to be curious about the hail...) After the hail, it was bitterly cold. (It's 37F outside right now... will probably be near freezing soon...)
