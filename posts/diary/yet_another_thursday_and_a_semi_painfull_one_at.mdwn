Yet another thursday. (And a semi-painfull one at that, after a long night of dancing.) Angela's textbook showed up today, so she wandered by to pick it up, right as I was leaving for class. [She was nice enough to drop me off at my lab, so I actually got there early for a change.] More work on some of the microarray stuff, and then I took care of beginning to grade the immunology midterms. Oi. I'm definelty going to get sick of grading those midterms well before I am finished.

Then I wandered home, and spent some more time grading midterms before I went to sleep.
