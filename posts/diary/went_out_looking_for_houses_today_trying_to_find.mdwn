Went out looking for houses today, trying to find one close for when I move out of the residence halls. (Finally!) After that my family and I ate at the riverside brewing company, which is pretty decent. Took care of some other random stuff around here, played baskettbal, tried to get ready for my midterms, and that was pretty much the day. Hopefully I'll get the PMS sytem up and running and get passwords out for the new pellam on wednesday. Ooo Exciting.
