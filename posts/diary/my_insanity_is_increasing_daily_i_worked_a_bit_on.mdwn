My insanity is increasing daily. I worked a bit on my grant proposal for bio200a. It's comming extreemly slowly, partly because I'm stuck just getting started with the background. Hopefully it will work itself out sometime tomorrow.

Was hopeing to do something else besides work in the house today, but this rain agrees with working. Tomorrow it's time to make samples for a pkc assay, and I have nmr time over night on wednesday. Isn't life wonderful?
