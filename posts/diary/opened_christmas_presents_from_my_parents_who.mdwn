Opened christmas presents from my parents, who picked up a tool set from sears for me. Then I laid about before going to covina hills where my late grandfather's wife prepared yet another dinner for us. It was quite good, and I got to visit with Alexander, who is working on getting his pilot's license in tulsa, oklahoma.

Later, we wandered back to riverside, and me and my brother went to see Lord Of The Rings for the second time. (It's going to be quite a long and painful wait for the next LotR.)

More work, reading, and then hopefully, sleep.
