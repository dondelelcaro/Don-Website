Had a filling put in by the dentist today, came back out to riverside, did some work at home, and then wandered onto campus. I ran into Tim while on campus and chatted for a bit about what was going on... then I went back to my lab to continue working on the assignments that I had to take care of, and discuss the results of the biophysical society meeting with my major professor.\n\nAfter startbucks, I came back to the house, made dinner, did some more work, and watched a flick. I also scored some more books earlier in the day from the library.
