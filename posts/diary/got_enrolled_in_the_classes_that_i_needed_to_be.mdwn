Got enrolled in the classes that I needed to be enrolled in, and took care of getting keys to the scintilation room and the grad student mailroom, so I'll actually be able to receive mail that comes there. (ugh... just what I need, more junk mail...)

I also did some more work on understanding the statistics and mathematics of the baysian microarray approach. I'm going to need to do alot more work on it before I am totally happy with it, but I'm getting started.

Also remade the calcium chloride buffer and magnesium cloride buffer for the PKC assay. Not sure if that was causing the lackluster results that we were getting recently, but it might have been. (Posit that Ca2+ is sticking to the glass, lowering the Ca2+ concentration availble in an unmixed stock 0.01M CaCl2 solution.)
