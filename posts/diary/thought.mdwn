[thought]\nAs I was walking, I found out that I could change the way that people around me thought of myself.\n\nThis was one of the most powerful revalations I had ever had.\n\nOf course, I didn't realize the nature of the transformation that had happened to me that day until much later. At the time, it scared me. It was only later that I realized that that really was the appropriate emotion. My transformation really would change my life for ever.
