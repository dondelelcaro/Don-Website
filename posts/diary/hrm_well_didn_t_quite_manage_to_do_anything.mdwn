Hrm. Well, didn't quite manage to do anything today.\n\nTried to work some more on the statistics for the microarrays, and didn't get to it.\n\nAbout all I managed to do succesfully was wash my car, which hadn't been washed in quite some time. Luckily, it spends almost all of it's life in the garage, so it was relatively clean, but it still needed to be debugged from my trip to SF and some other jaunts around SC.\n\nWas planning on spending some time hanging out with Mandee, but she didn't end up calling me after she got out from work. Anyway, onto some reading and then glorious sleep.
