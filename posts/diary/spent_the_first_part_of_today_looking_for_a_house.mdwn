Spent the first part of today looking for a house to live in while I'm in graduate school. Found a house south of campus, and it looks like we're going to do a deal on it. After that I spent some time dealing withy ramifications of a hsot crash on camus (locked dhcpd looking for math.ucr.edu... mathserv.ucr.edu's named blew great big chunks...), working on pms a bit, trying to get it to be faster and more stable, and then went to play basketball. Totally forgot that it was playoff time and my bball game was tomrrow instead of today. Oh well.
