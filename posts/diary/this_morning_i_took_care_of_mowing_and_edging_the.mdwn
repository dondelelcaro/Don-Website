This morning I took care of mowing and edging the two front lawns. They haven't been edged in a while, so that took some time, but I think they turned out reasonably acceptably.

After that, I did some more reading and talking with people at the house, and wandered off to Chicago Pasta House for dinner.

After dinner, I went to the lab and continued working on the gene array experiments, and then came home and prepared to fall alseap.
