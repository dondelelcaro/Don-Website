Turned in my gnt240a assignment, and then worked on getting the last remaining sample that needed to be rerun before our postor presentation on sunday next week made and vacuumed. Also picked up some nmr time, and finished the third book in the thomas covenant, unbeliever series. (Now I have to read the second trilogy.)
