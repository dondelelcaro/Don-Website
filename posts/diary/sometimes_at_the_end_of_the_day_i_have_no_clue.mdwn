Sometimes at the end of the day, I have no clue what I did during the day. Today was one of those days. Just millions of little tasks that had gotten piled up ontop of eachother... quite a few of them got taken care of today.

My room got cleaned slightly, and a whole bunch of loads of laundry got taken care of. My board got setup, and I started getting my papers for school organized. I know, it's already half way through the quarter, but I'm not really much for organization at all.

I also finally got the diary scripts working correctly, and rebuild the diaries, so this is probably the first newly updated diary entry that anyone else besides me is seeing.
