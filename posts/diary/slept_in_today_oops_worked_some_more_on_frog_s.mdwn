Slept in today. Oops. Worked some more on frog's leap, got samples run for NMR, went to meetings, took the new RCC's on a tour, and spent some time cleaning up after a root on a linux box in Dr. Z's lab. Was a bit lazy setting that one up, so the dude(tte) broke in through nfs and then installed two backdoors and a DoSer to run through inittab. Got C&C on campus watching it, and they started to freak out when I tracerouted the bastard. (They're just watching packet flow, but not doing any packet dumping. Oh well.)
