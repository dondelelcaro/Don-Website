Spent most of today grading papers.

Paid some bills too.

Also finished reading book 2 in the thomas covenant, unbeliever series. But unfortunatly, I've also developed a nasty head cold, so most of the day (that I wasn't grading papers) I spent in bed. Still have a bit to go on the midterms that I have to grade... but I'll get there.
