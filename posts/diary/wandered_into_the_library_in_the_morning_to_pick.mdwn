Wandered into the library in the morning to pick up some books (Do Androids dream of electric sheep, cryptonomicon, and a few others). After that, I left riverside for huntington beach, and christmas eve. My mother made rotkohl, roast, salad, and all the appropriate trimmings of a proper german christmas dinner. (I'm way to fond of rotkohl for my own good.) Then christmas presents, followed by midnight mass.

It's always unusual going to church when one is a determinist (in the modern sense of the word), and furthermore, a biologist by training. But I will speak no further of my quandries in that area.

Then we wandered back home, and I took care of some work that had piled up between noon and midnight (although I still have some more to do).
