[[agimg 2004/03_march/new_shelves_2004_0327/002_more_of_the_desk_and_beer_20040327.jpg ]] Those of you who know me know that I have a penchant for reading lots and lots of books... most of the time I read stuff from the library, but I'm starting to have a relatively substantial collection of physical books of my own. Today I finally got around to putting in some shelving to handle some of the books that have been sitting around everywhere. Unfortunatly, I still need to get bookends to handle the rest of them, but at least its a start towards getting things slightly better organized in my room.
