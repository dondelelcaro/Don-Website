Woke up, and set up and cut the door for the guest room, got the door almost correct (still need to plane a bit off of it). Installed the lock hardware, and patched up the hole left from the previous lock hardware.\n\nKatie, the new occupant of the room, dropped off money and stuff. She'll be moving in on sunday. Ate at getaway with my aunt, came back and did some more work, prepared figures for a paper and fixed some problems with the helical wheel generator, and then went to bed.
