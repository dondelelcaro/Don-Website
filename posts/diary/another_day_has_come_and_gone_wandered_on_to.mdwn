Another day has come and gone. Wandered on to campus to get some more books on natural langage parsing. Still trying to figure out what I am going to do as far as that is concerned.\n\nStarted reading LotR again, just so I can refresh it in my mind. I'll probably end up getting the history of middle earth books relatively soon, assuming my tax bills aren't outrageous.\n\nAnyway, off to sleep. Hopefully I'll pick up some more books and go to free thinking tomorrow.
