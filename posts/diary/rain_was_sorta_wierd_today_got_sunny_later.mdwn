Rain was sorta wierd today. Got sunny later. Anyway, I went to my classes, tried to get pellam switched over to the new name, but no such luck. Spent some time working on PMS, getting the new card readers to work, a program for one infinity, some web page hacking, and more studying for biology 107A, in which I have a midterm next monday. Oy Vay. Hopefully I'll get some more stuff done tomorrow.
