Had a bunch of classes today, and a nasty quiz at 8A. People really shouldn't hold classes that early. Got nics for the PMS, getting them to boot via NFS. Going to fix pms for the new card readers tomorrow. Spent some time hanging out with paul, and chillin on campus. Hopefully I'll find something interesting to do tomorrow. ;-)
