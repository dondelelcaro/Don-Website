Met with the undergrads who are going to be working in my lab again this quarter... looks like they had a good winter break.

I attended the first GNT 240A course at 1P, promises to be somewhat interesting, although the second quarter of instruction interests me more than the first quarter.

Figured out what I need to do in order to apply for a leave of absence, and came back home, to do more work before sleep.
