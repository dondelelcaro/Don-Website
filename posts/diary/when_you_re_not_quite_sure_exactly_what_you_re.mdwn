When you're not quite sure exactly what you're doing, sometimes it's acceptable to do nothing at all. Sometimes it's not.

More work on the reference system, spent some time reading, and watching tv. Haven't really watched TV since sometime 3 weeks ago. Still a waste of time. (Although junkyard wars and battlebots was kind of interesting...) Um.. yeah. More eating, and stuff and working, and writing, and sleep. Yeah. Lots of sleep. (We're nearing the end of the quarter. One last week of instruction, then finals. Oooo... yippie.)
