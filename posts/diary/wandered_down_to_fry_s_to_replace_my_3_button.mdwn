Wandered down to fry's to replace my 3 button mouse that had crapped out on me. I hate that place, but when you need something electronic quick, where else are you going to go?\n\nMore work on GM's system, looks like it's working now. Got sleep working with benh-2.4.17 on my g4 powerbook.. it's nice. Found gkrellm and it's working really well (after finding bubblefishymon.. quite silly but kind of cute). More reading and stuff to take care of tomorrow. Hopefully the new dual p4 will show up. That will be kind of fun to play with.\n\nOh yeah... also went grocery shopping and picked up some food so I'll be able to eat and drink for the near future. Also looked at digital cameras. Maybe when I come into some more money I'll pick one up.
