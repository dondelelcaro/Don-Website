You never know what sort of madness the day has in store, or the side effects a single choice might contain. The beginning of the day today, was one not unlike many others. I spent it working on problems that affect my research into many different areas. Progress was made upon them, in some areas progress that was unexpected.

Yet today, a subtle decision to go see a movie, obstensibly about orchids, brought with it a whole other side of life stories. A man struggling to find identity in his own pathetic little life, albiet in show business where no one really knows who he is exactly, finds himself rediscovering the life that he thought he lost through the resurgence of passion in those around him.

Obviously I was extremly impressed by Adaptation, one of the new filmes by Charlie Kaufman. If you haven't yet seen it, you definetly should.
