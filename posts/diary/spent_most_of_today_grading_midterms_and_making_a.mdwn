Spent most of today grading midterms and making a few adjustments to one of the scripts that I use to parse the analyzed array data. (There are some more changes that need to be made to it, but it is nearing completion.)\n\nHung out with angela for a bit at her place, sort of watched TV for a bit and had almond mochas (mmm..).\n\nI also finished up the final sample and stuck it into the freezer to freeze for a bit. I'll have to cycle it through freeze-thaw sometime tomorrow.\n\nNow it's time to go envelope myself in sleep.
