Today I managed to pass my qualification exams for PhD with my proposal on Cholesterol and Sphingomyelin enrichment of lipid bilayers and the effect on membrane structure and signal transduction. Now I get to spend the next few years getting the research for my thesis ready so I can actually graduate.

I'll link to my proposal in a bit in case anyone wants to look at it for any reason.
