Yet another day has come and is going rapidly. Spent this one working on a presentation that I have to give on wednesday and getting stuff in order for a lab experiment that I have to get started on tuesday. When I was returning a few books to the library, I ran across a bit of political grafiti on the election... seems that at least some people think that arnold is going to be a problematic governer.

Sometime in the next few days we'll find out exactly who is going to win the California recall. Kind of disturbing really, that only 900,000 signatures are necessary to force a million dollar election. Oh well. I hope those 900,000 people really understood what they were getting themselves into when they signed the recall petitions.
