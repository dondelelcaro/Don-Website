Well, I was supposed to make and run a PKC assay today, but the samples ended up getting loused up, and so we had to remake them. No big loss. I continued working on some other stuff, and then came home to deal the most superficial way possible with my room and the new monitor card I got.

Unfortunatly, the silly pci card won't softboot, even though it's neighbor farther up the chain will. I'm going to have to figure out what is going on with it eventually. (Hopefully someone will tell me what stuff I need to write to the pci card to get it to boot up, and then it will just magically work.)
