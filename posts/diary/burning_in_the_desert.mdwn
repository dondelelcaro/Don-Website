[[!agimg 2004/06_june/desert_party_20040605/004_everyone_dancing_20040605.jpg ]]Yesterday I got to wander out into the desert with Addy, Chris, Josh,
Tish, and the rest of the mad people and their soundsystems who were 7
miles off the 15 before Zzyzx. 110F in the sun, a few miles of
ridiculously deep gravel which ate cars for lunch, yours truely
impersonating Peter Solberg in his subaru, and it's a desert party
with all the trappings.

desert party entails, I spent most of last night and today asleep,
until I woke up to finish grading stuff for Bio5B. Yes, terribly
exciting, no?
