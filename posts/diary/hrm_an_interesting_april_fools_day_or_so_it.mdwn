Hrm... an interesting april fools day, or so it seems. It was the first day of classes today, and in classic form, I wasn't on campus until 10P or so. I spent most of the day dealing with random stuff, and pulling a book list of books that I want to pick up. As is usual, two of them were not in the shelves, so I stuck a search out on them... who knows if they'll be found at all.\n\nChatted with paul at starbucks for quite a while about his spring break, and some of his plans for the future. Then wandered back home to read some more before sleeping.
