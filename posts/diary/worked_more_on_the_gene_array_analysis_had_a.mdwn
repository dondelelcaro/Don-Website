Worked more on the gene array analysis, had a conference call with betza, joe, and raphael on it.

Collected and analized the pkc data... looks like a problem where the calcium is going to need to be remade. Quite exciting.

I also signed up for NMR time on tuesday from 3- wednesday at 1, and went to GNT 240A again. I'll need to sign up for that class tomorrow, along with 2 addtional units of research.

Spent some time playing with dancer-ircd... probably get that working at home in the next couple of days.

Angela's package still hasn't arrived... looks like amazon straight up isn't going to ship it for whatever reason. Seems kind of lameo to me.
