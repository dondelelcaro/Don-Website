Ran a PKC assay today with the undergraduates in my lab. Looks like it went fairly well. I'll really only know the results on friday. Hopefully it turned out.

I also did some more writing for my paper in Bio200a, trying to work out some more of the background information. I'm basically wading through some more of the papers that I need to do the background, and hopefully will have that and a good portion of the experimental part done by saturday. At least, that's the plan.
