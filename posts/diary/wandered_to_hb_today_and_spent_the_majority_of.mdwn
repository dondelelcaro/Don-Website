Wandered to HB today, and spent the majority of the day working on my table.

The top is almost finished... it was cut out using a sabre saw, and the edges were rounded over using a 1/4" rounding over bit. It's out of particle board, and will need to be filled and sanded before I paint it, but for starters, it looks ok.

I'm still trying to figure out exactly what I'm going to do for legs. I'm probably going to go simplistic, and maybe make some triangular necked legs for the table... but I'm not entirely sure what I want to do there. (It will come to me at some point in time, and there will then be no doubt as to the correct approach.)

After that, I wandered back to riverside, and spent the remainder of the day reading and cleaning up some stuff around the house before sleep came over me.
