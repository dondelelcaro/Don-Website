Pellam is now almost ready for users to be unleashed on it. Just have to add the user mode php stuff, so php users can't wreak havoc on other php user's files. Sent out the RCC selection notices late today, spent some time chillin' with Paul at In-N-Out, and chatting with people around here in general. Tried to find some more ports to plug machines in our basement. In general, a fairly productive day, but way to much stuff still needs to happen. Hopefully tomorrow will be up to par.
