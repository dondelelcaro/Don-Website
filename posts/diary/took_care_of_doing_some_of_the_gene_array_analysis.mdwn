Took care of doing some of the gene array analysis today. In the middle of that, I went to GNT 240A, and listened to another lecture on an introduction to gene finding and sequence alignment. Still nothing deeply technical, mainly just overview, but still worth listening too.

Then more gene array analysis, starbucks, home, and work before going to sleep.
