Over the past 24 hours, an interesting set of threads has been going on in [http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel|debian-devel] and [http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal|debian-legal] about the possible inclusion of [http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/|mplayer] in Debian. Well, actually, it was much more of a flamewar that only occasionally touched on the actually inclusion, and spent more time dealing with anciliary name calling and pointless unreferenced performance information. Not like that is all that big of a surprise, considering the [http://216.239.57.100/search?q=cache:ma_D0T3sFhoC:mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/mplayer-flame/2001-December/000160.html+mplayer+developers+flaming&hl=en&ie=UTF-8|track] [http://www.linuxworld.com/site-stories/2001/1214.mplayer.html|record] of [http://freshmeat.net/projects/mplayer/?topic_id=127%2C128|abuse] leveled at users.

So that was interesting, until it links to the thread get pasted to [http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/|mplayer's website], and then finally, [http://www.slashdot.org/|slashdot], and the hordes of trolls are unleashed upon debian-devel and debian-legal. One wonders what the ftp masters are going to do considering that the packages have been uploaded to incomming.
