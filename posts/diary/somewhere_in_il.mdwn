[[agimg 2003/07_july/to_pikes_peak_IA_07012003/01_entering_chicago_07012003.jpg ]]I'm currently stoped at a Wendy's after having refilled my car at a
local shell. For some ungodly reason I really like Wendy's
hamburgers. I probably should stop eating fast food entirely
though. Anyway, I passed through Chicago very slowly, as the 90/94 was
totally jammed until well outside of Chicago (almost until
O'hare). Chicago looks really interesting, but as I've got 480 miles
to do today, I won't be spending any time there at all. [Perhaps in
the future?]

I'm going to finish off my hamburger, and get back into the car to do
the last leg of today. I only have about 200 miles left. [Another 3
hours or so.]

Almost forgot, I took a few shots of Chicago as I was driving through,
but I haven't really had a chance to check them out. Hopefully they
turned out ok.
