[gal://2003/07_july/to_pikes_peak_IA_07012003/01_entering_chicago_07012003.jpg]I'm currently stoped at a Wendy's after having refilled my car at a\nlocal shell. For some ungodly reason I really like Wendy's\nhamburgers. I probably should stop eating fast food entirely\nthough. Anyway, I passed through Chicago very slowly, as the 90/94 was\ntotally jammed until well outside of Chicago (almost until\nO'hare). Chicago looks really interesting, but as I've got 480 miles\nto do today, I won't be spending any time there at all. [Perhaps in\nthe future?]\n\nI'm going to finish off my hamburger, and get back into the car to do\nthe last leg of today. I only have about 200 miles left. [Another 3\nhours or so.]\n\nAlmost forgot, I took a few shots of Chicago as I was driving through,\nbut I haven't really had a chance to check them out. Hopefully they\nturned out ok.
