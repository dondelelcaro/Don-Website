Went to class this morning for bio200a, learned about the movement of chromosomes and the formation of asters via dynein and kinesin, then went into by lab to finish off my grant.

I turned it in at 4:50, ten minutes before it was due, and then went home to attempt to deal with stuff that had been negleted during the writing of the grant. Managed to add the correct angle and an arrow head to my program that draws trans membrane helical wheels, so it's basically ready to produce journal quality figures. Also managed to talk to erik and some of the RCC's who are currently running the network that I adminstered over the past couple of years....

Continued reading The Name of the Rose, which seems to be a relatively decent book, although there are some gaps in the literary style of the authos, and crashed.
