Man, it rained again today. Anyway, finally got the card readers for PMS working, missed a character in track1 that was messing up the pattern matching. The code is working now, but probably needs to be robustified. Fixed up my resume, upgraded mysql on etarre, fixed psdeamon, helped some staff members using equation editor, and fixed up my resume. I also populated some more of the cvs modules on etarre, so they now actually have the current file status in them. Hopefully I'll be keeping these up to date. ;-)
