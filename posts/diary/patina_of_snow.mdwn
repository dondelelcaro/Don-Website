[gal://new_camera_pictures/monday_of_snow_02102003/white_parking_lot_3_02102003.jpg] I almost forgot to put up the pictures I shot of the snow from yesterday that totally blanketed the parking lot. And ideed, as I write this, it's started to come down again. It's much nicer when everything is covered in a layer of white. (At least, it's better than when the snow starts melting and turns grey and black.)\n\n[gal://misc_pictures/snowy_subaru_02112003.jpg]\nAnyway, I worked for a while at work, then ended up playing at dicky's from 12-1. One of these days I'll have to get around to cutting a demo cd that I can hand out. On the way back, I had some fun sliding around in my car... driving on icy roads is definetly one of the more exciting things to do here.
