Still a bit sick, but pretty much had a down day today. Watched UCR get beat at their homecomming game, got ImageMagick installed properly and serving the images on the front page, did some install stuff, and worked on finalizing the RCC Selections. I also got [http://faqomatic.sourceforge.net|fom] working on [http://pellam.ucr.edu|new pellam], worked on a couple of scripts, clean up some of the pictures I have, and decided that my room really is thrashed.
