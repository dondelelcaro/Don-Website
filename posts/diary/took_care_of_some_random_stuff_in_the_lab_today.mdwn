Took care of some random stuff in the lab today.

Came home and did some more work on the reference system, and also did some more reading. Managed to screw up an NMR sample. (Well, not really, there just wasn't enough BBPC).

Then I drove with Angela out to Angela's to get ready and go to release with Sam. Release is now being held at Atlas. Nicely, angela, angela, and sam all got hooked up with free drinks and sam got us in before release started. Music was ok, there were about 5 tracks out of 50 or so that were good... the rest merely average, but danceable.

Then a loooong drive back out to riverside, and glorious sleep.
