Went to a discussion and heard about Rop and Ras, proteins involved in signal transduction with GTPase activity. Too bad both papers were on virtually the same bit of the signal transduction patway and weren't terribly strong into a moduleation of the pathway via pharmacological agents.

Then picked up my grant after it was graded... didn't get butchered too badly. Collected data, ordered Hot ATP, and then came home to do some more work on my reference collector (which seems to be working well.) Chilled at starbucks for a bit, worked some more, and slept.
