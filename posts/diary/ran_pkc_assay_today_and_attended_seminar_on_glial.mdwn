Ran PKC assay today, and attended seminar on glial cells. Afterwords I actually got to socialize with some of the people in the class... some of which I've never talked with before... one of the graduate students (now graduated) who is doing postdoc work at USC dropped by after listening to a friends defense, and there was food for people.

Then finished up the assay, froze as I rode my bike home, and took care of a little bit of stuff before sleep. Odly, I had a venti coffe at starbucks, and I can barely feel the effects. I'm definetly a caffeine addict.
