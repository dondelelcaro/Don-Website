Loads of coding dealing with trying to get my reference software to interact with pubmed.

Looks like I'm going to have to duplicate some php code in perl, as php just isn't powerfull enough, nor multi-thread capable enough to deal with pubmed's slow generation of sgml. (I'm going to multiplex to pubmed almost 100 connections, and doing it syncronously isn't going to work.)

Got to take care of making the jacked figures for this paper. Will happen very shortly.
