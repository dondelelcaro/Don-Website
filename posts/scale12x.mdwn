[[!meta title="Debian Booth at Scale 12x"]]

I spent the weekend at
[SCALE 12x](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/blog/scale-12x) running the
[Debian](http://www.debian.org) booth. SCALE is one of the best
conferences that I get to attend every year; it has a great mix of
commercial exhibitors and community groups, and routinely gets great
speakers. As I've done for quite some time, I organized a Debian booth
there, and talked to lots of people about Debian.

If you're in the Southern California area, or have a chance to give a
talk for SCALE 13x, you should do so! Thanks again to Matt Kraai and
Paul Hardy for helping out in the Debian booth all weekend!
