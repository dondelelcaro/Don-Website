[[!meta title="libravatar for the BTS (and boring encoding fixes)"]]

While working on fixing a few encoding problems that I managed to
introduce to the BTS almost half a year ago, I took a side bit of
coding, and introduced [libravatar](https://www.libravatar.org/)
support to the BTS. Every e-mail now has an avatar to the right which
should correspond to the sender. Libravatar is a federated service,
which means that if you control your domain, you can serve your own
icons. It also automatically falls back to gravatar, so if you're
using that service, things should "just work". Hopefully this will be
primarily amusing, and people won't abuse it.

More importantly, but much less fun, the double encoding problems
(where mails would get double-encoded if any of the headers contained
non-us-ascii text), and mojibake wontfix icon (â˜¹) should be fixed now.
If you see any additional cases of this, please report them to
owner@bugs.debian.org.
