[[!meta title="Causative SLE allele in NCF2 paper published"]] 

This year has been fairly good for our lab; a few years ago we found
an association of
[rs17849502](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=rs17849502)
with SLE. Finally, after significant work by our collaborators, we
managed to demonstrate a functional significance of this SNP with
possible importance for SLE. Changing H389 to Q reduces the function
of the NADPH oxidase complex by 50% in Vav dependent FcÎ³ response.
