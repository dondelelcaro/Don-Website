[[!meta title="Making a dbsnp mirror"]]

If you're doing genetics and use SNP, you've probably often wanted to
extract information from dbSNP. A long time ago, I wrote some scripts
to scrape their webpages for information. Now that I'm dealing with
millions of SNPs, that's no longer possible. I needed my own mirror of
dbSNP. I did this as of build 132, and since they've now released
build 135, I wrote up [[what to do|genetics/dbsnp_mirror]], and shared the
[git repository](http://git.donarmstrong.com/dbsnp.git) which has the
utilities and schemas I used.
