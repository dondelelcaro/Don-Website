[[!meta title="Switching to KGB from CIA"]] 

[CIA.vc](http://cia.vc) has unfortunately
[disappeared](http://shadowm.rewound.net/blog/archives/245-CIA.vc-is-dead.html),
and is [unlikely to return](http://pastebin.com/9RBBniM1) any time
soon. I personally have decided to switch to
[KGB](http://kgb.alioth.debian.org/), but other alternatives such as
[FBI](http://fbi.github.com) and
[irker](http://www.catb.org/esr/irker/) exist.


To switch, you first need to find or set up a kgb bot. If this is a
Debian associated FOSS project, feel free to contact me or join
\#kgb-devel on irc.oftc.net and ask for someone to allow your project
to talk to their bot. Once you've found a bot, we need to set up the
client. [I'll talk about bot set up at the end.]

kgb-client configuration
------------------------

Install the `kgb-client` and `kgb-client-git` packages. Currently, kgb
only supports subversion, git, and cvs, but support for additional
VCSes continue to be added as kgb gains popularity.

For git repositories, add a post-receive hook like the following:

    #!/bin/sh
    tee hooks/reflog | kgb-client --conf /path/to/kgbclient.conf --repository git --git-reflog -

For subversion repositories, add a post-commit hook like the following:

    #!/bin/sh
    kgb-client --conf /path/to/kgbclient.conf --repository svn "$1" "$2"
	
Then update the configuration file `/path/to/kgbclient.conf`:

    ---
	repo-id: my-repository
	servers:
	 - uri: http://servername:9999/
	   password: verysecret
	# optional link to a website where the commits are;
	# needs newish kgb-client and server
	web-link: http://example.com/?p=my-repository;a=commitdiff;h=${commit}

Then, send the bot owner the password, repo-id, channel, and network
you'd like the changes to be reported to.

Configuring kgb-bot
-------------------

The bots just listen to soap requests and if the password matches,
sends the commit to the appropriate IRC channel. To set one up,
install `kgb-bot`.

Then, enable the bot (set `BOT_ENBALED=1` in `/etc/default/kgb-bot`),
and configure the bot's configuration file `/etc/kgb-bot/kgb.conf`:

    ---
    soap:
      server_addr: 0.0.0.0
      server_port: 9999
      service_name: KGB
    queue_limit: 150
    log_file: "/var/log/kgb-bot.log"
    repositories:
      # just a name to identify it
      my-repository:
        # needs to be the same on the client
        password: verysecret
	networks:
      oftc:
        nick: KGB-you
        ircname: KGB bot
        username: kgb
        password: ~
        nickserv_password: yournickservpassword
        server: irc.oftc.net
        port: 6667
      freenode:
        nick: KGB-you
        ircname: KGB bot
        username: kgb
        password: ~
        nickserv_password: yournickservpassword
        server: irc.freenode.net
        port: 6667
	channels:
      - name: '#your-channel'
        network: oftc
        repos:
         - your-repo
	  - name: '#commits'
	    network: freenode
		repos:
		 - your-repo
		

Then start the bot (`/etc/init.d/kgb-bot start`), and watch as it
joins channels and reports your changes!

You'll probably actually want to register whatever nick you are using
on the networks, etc... but you can figure that out yourself!
