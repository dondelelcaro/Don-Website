[[!meta title="Dealing with Greenhouse Whiteflies"]]

This weekend, I finally got around to dealing with the
[Greenhouse whitefly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_whitefly)
infestation we've had on the basil and mint in the kitchen window.
We've previously tried
[Pyrethrin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrethrin)-based
insecticides, but eventually the whiteflies came back.

After a bit of research, it appears that insecticide resistance is a
fairly common occurrence with whiteflies, and other alternative
approaches are needed to manage the infestation. In our case, since
the plants are relatively small, I opted for drowning the plants for a
few moments, and then putting yellow sticky traps out. Hopefully this
will at least let the basil come back and keep the whiteflies under
wraps.
