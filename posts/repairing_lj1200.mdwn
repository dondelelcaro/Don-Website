[[!meta title="LaserJet 1200 Printer Repair"]]

[[!agimg /2011/printer_repair_20111205/solenoid_1.jpg]] My lab's aging
LaserJet 1200 recently started failing in an interesting fashion. It
would print a page nicely, but then attempt to feed a second page
before the first had finished, leading to a jam. Some googling lead me
to [this page](http://www.fixyourownprinter.com/forums/printer/68177)
which indicated that the feed solenoid was sticking. After a failed
attempt to clean gunk off of the feed solenoid arm (and failing to
find anything else wrong, I wrapped the feed solenoid arm in scotch
tape and attempted again. Viola, a printer working once again.
