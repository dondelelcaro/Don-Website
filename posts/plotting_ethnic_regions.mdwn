[[!meta title="Plotting Ethnic Regions"]]

I was asked over the weekend how to plot SNPs which are associated
with specific ethnicities; the following code is a really quick stab
at the problem using the grid graphics engine in R.

[[!sweavealike fig=1 echo=1 results="hide" code """
require(grid)
snp.position <- 1:10
snp.integers <- sample.int(5,size=length(snp.position),replace=TRUE)
### the position is really the midpoint of the range
snp.midpoint <- snp.position
### start of the SNP; we're assuming it should start at 0.
snp.start <- c(0,snp.position[-1]-diff(snp.position)/2)
### stop of the snp; we're assuming it should stop at the last snp position
snp.stop <- c(snp.position[-length(snp.position)]+diff(snp.position)/2,
	snp.position[length(snp.position)])
snp.width <- snp.stop - snp.start

### these are the colors
possible.colors <- c("red","blue","yellow","green","purple")
snp.colors <- possible.colors[snp.integers]

### this sets up the viewport that we'll plot into
pushViewport(viewport(height=unit(1,"npc")-unit(7,"lines"),
width=unit(1,"npc")-unit(7,"lines")
	))
pushViewport(dataViewport(xscale=range(c(0,snp.stop)),yscale=c(0,1)))

### this draws a rectangle around the graph
grid.rect()
### this sets up the x axis
grid.xaxis()
### this labels the X axis
grid.text("Position on Chromosome",y=unit(-2.5,"lines"))

### this draws all of the boxes corresponding to each SNP in the
### appropriate color
grid.rect(x=unit(snp.start,"native"),
        width=unit(snp.width,"native"),
        y=unit(0.5,"native"),
        height=unit(0.25,"native"),just=c("left","center"),
        gp=gpar(col=snp.colors,fill=snp.colors))

### this pops the viewport
popViewport(2)
