[[!meta title="Debian R Archive"]]

For those of you were were in the various Debian infrastructure
channels, you might have noticed that I was playing around with
wanna-build, dak, sbuild, and buildd and friends.
[Thanks to everyone who answered questions, btw.] Over the past week,
I've been building most of [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org),
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org), and
[omegahat](http://www.omegahat.org) for unstable, amd64. I plan to
build the same set of packages for i386, and will start a build
shortly for stable as well. This effort builds on top of Charles
Blundell and Dirk Eddelbuettel's
[cran2deb](http://debian.cran.r-project.org/), which does most of the
heavy lifting.

If you're like me, and use lots of different R packages, or already
use some of the R packages available on the previous build, you can
simply point your sources.list to the [http://debian-r.debian.net]
archive, load the appropriate GPG key, and away you go. I have a bit
more information available [[debian_r|here]] and I will try to keep
that page updated as I build other architectures and build out for
stable.
