[[!meta title="X200 Bios Update on Debian"]] 

Updating the bios on my X200 Tablet was surprisingly simple in Debian.
Often, updating bios requires some sort of Windows or Dos boot disk
and all kinds of machinations to make that happen. Lenovo provides an
iso image to update the bios which alleviates some of these problems,
but as the X series don't have built-in CDROM drives (and I don't have
an ultrabay), 

All you have to do is download the
[iso](http://download.lenovo.com/ibmdl/pub/pc/pccbbs/mobiles/7wuj43uc.iso),
install syslinux `aptitude install syslinux`, and configure grub to
start memdisk and boot off of the iso. You can do this by copying the
iso to your boot partition (`cp 7wuj43uc.iso /boot/;`), copying
memdisk to the boot partition (`cp /usr/lib/syslinux/memdisk /boot/;`
and adding an entry to your grub.cfg like the following (putting it in
/etc/grub.d/40_custom is probably the most reasonable).

    menuentry "Thinkpad x200 BIOS Upgrade to 3.19" {
           insmod part_msdos
           insmod ext2
           set root='(hd0,msdos1)'
           linux16 /memdisk iso
           initrd16 /7wuj43uc.iso
    }

Note that your configuration will be slightly different depending on
whether you have a separate /boot partition (I do) or not.

Then you just need to boot the laptop, select the bios upgrade option
in grub, and tell the program that you really do want to upgrade the
bios and that you really do have a full battery and the laptop plugged
into an AC adapter.
