[[!meta title="Using Term::Progressbar"]] 

I've been working for a while on analyzing a fairly large dataset for
my Lupus genetics project. One of the major annoyances with analyzing
large datasets is not knowing when a particular part of the analysis
is going to finish, and whether I should go back and rewrite part of
the code to be faster, or just wait for it to finish. In R, I've been
using txtProgressBar to handle this, but I hadn't bothered to find a
similar module for perl until now.

Luckily,
[Term::ProgressBar](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Term-ProgressBar/)
exists, and is pretty easy to use:

	my $pos = $sfh->tell();
    $sfh->seek(0,SEEK_END);
    my $p = Term::ProgressBar->new({count => $sfh->tell,
	                                remove => 1,
									ETA => 'linear'});
    $sfh->seek($pos,SEEK_SET);
    while (<$sfh>) {
		...; # yada yada yada
		$p->update($sfh->tell());		
	}

producing useful output, which told me that my SQLite database
creation routine would take about 2 days to finish instead of the 7
years that the slightly less optimal version wanted.
