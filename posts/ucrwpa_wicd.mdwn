[[!meta title="Using wicd on UCR's WPA network"]] 

UC Riverside's wireless network uses WPA-EAP for the encrypted
network. [The unencrypted network does a https based browser capture.]
Unfortunately, none of the default wicd encryption templates support
the precise brand of WPA that the network does, so you have to make
your own template. Luckily, wicd makes this fairly simple:

Create a new template, say, `/etc/wicd/encryption/templates/eap-only`,
with appropriate contents.

     name = EAP
     author = Don Armstrong
     version = 1
     require identity *Identity passwd *Password 
     
     -----
     ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
     network={
        ssid="$_ESSID"
        key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
        identity="$_IDENTITY"
        password="$_PASSWD"
     }

Then tell wicd about this new template by editing
`/etc/wicd/encryption/templates/active` and adding `eap-only` to the
existing list of templates, and restart wicd `/etc/init.d/wicd
restart`.
[I'm not sure if restarting wicd is necessary, but it shouldn't hurt.]

Finally, configure the network using the appropriate wicd interface as
usual.
