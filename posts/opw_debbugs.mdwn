[[!meta title="Virginia King selected for Debbugs FOSS Outreach Program for Women"]] 


I'm glad to announce that Virginia King has been selected as one of
the three interns for this round of the
[FOSS Outreach Program for women](https://gnome.org/opw/#participants).
Starting December 9th, and continuing until March 9th, she'll be
working on improving the documentation of
[Debian's bug tracking system](https://bugs.debian.org).

The initial goal is to develop a Bug Triager Howto to help new
contributors to Debian jump in and help existing teams triage bugs.
We'll be getting in touch with some of the larger teams in Debian to
help make this document as useful as possible. If you're a member of a
team in Debian who would like this howto to address your specific
workflow, please drop [me](mailto:don@debian.org) an e-mail, and we'll
keep you in the loop.

The secondary goals for this project are to:

 * Improve documentation under http://www.debian.org/Bugs
 * Document of bug-tags and categories
 * Improve upstream debbugs documentation
