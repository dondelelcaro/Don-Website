[[!meta title="Finding out Cytobands/Idiograms for assemblies"]]

In many organisms it is common to use
[idiograms](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Cytogenetics#Advent_of_banding_techniques)
or cytobands which provide information on approximately where
something is located on a chromosome in reference to the chromosome's
larger structure, or when exact locations are not required.

Until recently, I didn't know where [NCBI](http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
kept their idiogram annotations, which made my
[[mirror of dbsnp|genetics/dbsnp_mirror/]] (which I use to annotate my
whole genome analyses) slightly less useful than it could have been.
But, after a bit of searching of NCBI's ftp site, I was able to locate
the file in the new
[movie directory](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/MapView/Homo_sapiens/objects/current/initial_release): 
`ideogram_9606_GCF_000001305.13_850_V1`.

Then, a quick bit of work with SQL, I have the following schema:

    CREATE TABLE idiogram (
           chr TEXT NOT NULL,
           pq  TEXT NOT NULL,
           idiogram TEXT NOT NULL,
		   -- I think these are related to recombination rates, but I'm not sure
           rstart INT NOT NULL,
           rstop INT NOT NULL,
           start INT NOT NULL,
           stop INT NOT NULL,
		   -- I believe this indicates whether the band is black or white
           posneg TEXT NOT NULL
           );
           
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON idiogram(chr,pq,ideogram);
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON idiogram(chr,start);
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON idiogram(chr,stop);

and an additional bit of SQL in my SNP annotation perl script:

    SELECT CONCAT(chr,pq,idiogram) AS idiogram
      FROM idiogram
      WHERE idiogram.chr = ? AND idiogram.start <= ? AND idiogram.stop < ? LIMIT 1;

and some code:

    sub find_idiogram {
        my %param = @_;
    
        my %info;
        my $rv = $param{sth}->execute($param{chr},$param{pos},$param{pos}) //
    	die "Unable to execute statement properly: ".$param{dbh}->errstr;
        my ($idiogram) = map {ref $_ ?@{$_}:()} map {ref $_ ?@{$_}:()} $param{sth}->fetchall_arrayref([0]);
        if ($param{sth}->err) {
    	print STDERR $param{sth}->errstr;
    	$param{sth}->finish;
    	return 'NA';
        }
        $param{sth}->finish;
        return $idiogram // 'NA';
    }

and viola:

| id         | chr |      pos | idiogram | ref | alt | orig_id    | gene   | [...] |
|------------|-----|----------|----------|-----|-----|------------|--------|-------|
| rs10000010 |   4 | 21618674 | 4p16.3   | T   | C   | rs10000010 | KCNIP4 | [...] |

idiograms for every SNP.
