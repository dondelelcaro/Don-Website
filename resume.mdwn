I am a practitioner of the art of solving problems as elegantly and
practically as possible. I seek to enhance my abilities to solve
problems in the digital realm by learning (and inventing where
appropriate) new methods and techniques, and to help others achieve
their goals by removing or smoothing over ponderous obstacles in their
path. If you have difficult problems for which a digital approach
seems appropriate, I'm the person to talk to to find a solution.
